# stemma-flow

Local-first genealogy application in Rust. Family data lives in a single
SQLite database with an event-centric, Gramps-style model built for snappy
queries on trees with 10,000+ individuals.

## Build, test, run

```bash
cargo build   # compile
cargo test    # run the unit tests
cargo run     # create/open stemma-flow.db and initialise the schema
```

## Storage layer

`src/db` is the local storage layer:

- `db::open_connection(path)` opens a connection with the required pragmas:
  `journal_mode = WAL` and `foreign_keys = ON`.
- `db::init_db(&conn)` creates the schema (5 tables, 7 indexes) in a single
  batch transaction: `people`, `families`, `family_children`, `events`,
  `citations`.
- `db::{Person, Family, Event, Citation}` are the serde-enabled entity
  structs; ids are UUID strings.

Relationships are modelled through events and the `family_children` junction
table. Foreign keys cascade deletes from people/families down to events,
citations and child links, while spouses are detached with `ON DELETE SET NULL`.

## Graph layer

`src/model` holds the in-memory graph state the `egui` canvas renders:

- `model::GenealogyDb` wraps a `petgraph::stable_graph::StableGraph` plus a
  UUID -> `NodeIndex` map, so removing a person never invalidates the indices
  of everyone else.
- Edges carry `Relationship::ParentChild` (directional) or
  `Relationship::Spouse` (reciprocal); `add_parent_child` rejects self-links
  and cycles so the family graph stays acyclic.
- Traversals: `get_parents`, `get_children`, `get_spouses`, `get_ancestors`.

## GEDCOM 5.5.1

`src/gedcom` streams GEDCOM files in and out of the database:

- `gedcom::import_gedcom(&mut conn, reader)` parses line-by-line from any
  `BufRead` (low memory even for 50MB+ files), translates `@I1@`/`@F1@`
  pointers to UUIDs and writes everything inside a single transaction — I/O
  or database errors roll back the whole import. Recoverable problems
  (dangling pointers, malformed lines) come back as warnings in the returned
  `ImportReport`.
- `gedcom::export_to_gedcom(&conn)` serialises `people`, `families`,
  `family_children` and `events` back into a deterministic GEDCOM 5.5.1
  document (`HEAD`, `INDI`, `FAM`, `TRLR`).
- Family links are recovered from `HUSB`/`WIFE`/`CHIL`, backfilled from
  `FAMC`, and `FAMS` fills empty spouse slots when `SEX` makes it unambiguous.
